# FITTING
This directory contains scripts and data for fitting models to synthetic time series data. These scripts are designed to test the fitting capabilities of the MASFENON framework and to be easily adaptable for different types of time series data.
The fitting process is composed of more steps:
- create error matrix
- generate the parameters based on the error matrix

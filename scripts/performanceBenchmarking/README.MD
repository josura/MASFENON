# Performance Benchmarking
In this directory, you will find scripts designed to benchmark the performance of MASFENON compared to other simulation frameworks.
The benchmarks are run on synthetic data generated in the `syntheticDataCreation` directory.
The other simulation frameworks tested are:
- [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
- [NDLib](https://ndlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

/**
 * @file PropagationModel.cxx 
 * @ingroup Core
 * @brief Implements the PropagationModel class used for managing propagation dynamics for the computation of the perturbation in MASFENON.
 * @details The PropagationModel class provides methods for applying propagation logic to the perturbation computation.
 * @details The propagation class uses a scale function to determine the scaling of the propagation term. The scale function can be set and modified as needed.
